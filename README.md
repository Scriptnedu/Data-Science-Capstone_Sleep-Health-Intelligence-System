# Sleep & Lifestyle Intelligence Analysis

# Project Overview
This project explores how lifestyle factors such as physical activity, daily steps, stress levels, BMI, and other health indicators influence sleep duration and sleep quality. Using exploratory data analysis and correlation based insights, the study aims to identify which combinations of lifestyle behaviors are associated with healthier sleep profiles.

The analysis is designed to translate raw health data into clear, actionable insights for individuals, employers, and health-focused organizations.

 # Objectives
- Analyze relationships between lifestyle variables and sleep outcomes
- Identify key predictors of healthy sleep quality and duration
- Compare the relevance of physical activity level vs. daily steps
- Provide practical, real world recommendations based on findings

# Key Research Questions
- What relationship exists between physical activity and sleep outcomes?
- Which lifestyle factors most strongly correlate with good sleep quality?
- Is structured physical activity more impactful than total daily steps?
- What lifestyle combinations are associated with the healthiest sleep profiles?
  
# Dataset Description
The dataset includes health and lifestyle indicators such as:
- Sleep Duration  
- Sleep Quality  
- Physical Activity Level  
- Daily Steps  
- Stress Level  
- BMI Category  
- Other related health metrics  

# Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation  
- NumPy for numerical computations  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for data visualization  
- Jupyter Notebook for codes and analysis  

# Methodology
1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
   - Handling missing values
   - creating categorical variables where necessary

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Correlation matrices and heatmaps
   - Comparative plots for sleep outcomes

3. Comparative Analysis
   - Physical activity vs. daily steps
   - Composite lifestyle factor evaluation

4. Interpretation & Insight Communication
   - Health-focused interpretation of results
   - Practical implications beyond the dataset

# Key Insights
- Physical activity level shows a stronger relationship with sleep quality than daily step count alone
- Low stress levels combined with moderate to high activity are associated with healthier sleep profiles
- Simply increasing steps without intentional physical activity may not significantly improve sleep outcomes
